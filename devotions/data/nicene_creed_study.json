        "council_of_nicaea_325": "Formulated to defend the apostolic faith against the Arian heresy, which claimed the Son was a created being and that there was 'a time when he was not.' The Council affirmed the Son is 'homoousios' (of one substance) with the Father.",
        "council_of_constantinople_381": "Expanded the confession regarding the Holy Spirit to refute the 'Pneumatomachi' (fighters against the Spirit) and finalized the text generally used today.",

        "ousia_vs_hypostasis": "Early debates struggled with terminology. The Fathers eventually distinguished 'ousia' (essence/substance, which is common to the three) from 'hypostasis' (person/subsistence, which is particular to each). St. Jerome expressed hesitation to speak of 'three hypostases' fearing it implied three gods/essences, preferring 'one substance and three persons'.",
        "rule_of_faith": "The Creed functions as the 'regula fidei' (rule of faith), a summary of the broad scope of Scripture used to combat heresy. It is not an addition to Scripture but a synopsis of its doctrinal content."
