  "O Blessed Lord Jesus Christ, King of Glory, who, fulfilling Thy Father’s will, didst humble Thyself to suffer death upon the cross for the sins of the whole world. As the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world, Thou hast made atonement and reconciliation for all mankind. We pray Thee to help Thy servants and grant that every soul on earth may, through steadfast faith in Thy precious blood, be delivered from the power of the adversary and receive Thy promised redemption from everlasting death. For Thy mercy's sake, Who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. Amen.",
  "Almighty God, Heavenly Father, who through Thy Holy Spirit dost govern and sanctify the whole Christian Church, and hast given us the Comforter to be our Advocate and Guide. Vouchsafe, we beseech Thee, to direct, sanctify, and govern both our hearts and bodies in the ways of Thy laws. Enlighten and lead us into all truth and evermore defend us from all adversities, that, being made Thy children by grace, we may daily be renewed by Thy Spirit, and live in the continual comfort and peace of the Gospel. Through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord. Amen."

    "Almighty God, Heavenly Father, whose Providence upholds all created things and whose boundless love is new unto us every morning: As the shadows of the eventide deepen, we make our humble appeal unto Thy steadfast mercy. We pray that You would visit our homes and keep us both outwardly and inwardly, defending us by Thy mighty power from all adversities and all peril of body and soul. Cover us with the shadow of Thy wings, that we may not be afraid for the terror by night nor yield to the crafts and asserts of the devil, our wicked Foe. Grant us peaceful rest in the protection of Your holy angels, that we may wake to glorify Your name and live in the hope of everlasting life; through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, our Savior and only Refuge. Amen."

    "O Lord Jesus Christ, Thou heavenly Light, whom we acknowledge as our constant Companion and Guide. As the day is past and the eventide draws near, we humbly pray that You would abide with us. Direct us from error's gloomy night, and send forth Thy beams divine on our dark souls to shine. Kindle our hearts by the Word of Thy promise, and awaken within us the good hope of everlasting life. Grant us eyes of faith that we may recognize Your presence, as You are revealed when the Holy Scriptures are opened and in the mystical union of the breaking of the bread. Be Thou our Solace, Strength, and Stay, that we may be preserved in body and in soul. Hear us for Thy name's sake, O Lord, our Savior. Amem."

Direct our hearts and hands in our labor, that we may diligently attend to our calling, avoiding the temptations of sin and evil. Keep us steadfast in the holiness we have received in Christ so that our doings may be acceptable and our life a spiritual sacrifice of thanks to You. Through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord. Amen."
