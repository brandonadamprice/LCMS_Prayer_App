  "O Blessed Lord Jesus Christ, King of Glory, who, fulfilling Thy Father’s will, didst humble Thyself to suffer death upon the cross for the sins of the whole world. As the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world, Thou hast made atonement and reconciliation for all mankind. We pray Thee to help Thy servants and grant that every soul on earth may, through steadfast faith in Thy precious blood, be delivered from the power of the adversary and receive Thy promised redemption from everlasting death. For Thy mercy's sake, Who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. Amen.",
  "Almighty God, Heavenly Father, who through Thy Holy Spirit dost govern and sanctify the whole Christian Church, and hast given us the Comforter to be our Advocate and Guide. Vouchsafe, we beseech Thee, to direct, sanctify, and govern both our hearts and bodies in the ways of Thy laws. Enlighten and lead us into all truth and evermore defend us from all adversities, that, being made Thy children by grace, we may daily be renewed by Thy Spirit, and live in the continual comfort and peace of the Gospel. Through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord. Amen."

We pray that You would visit our homes and keep us both outwardly and inwardly, defending us by Thy mighty power from all adversities and all peril of body and soul. Cover us with the shadow of Thy wings, that we may not be afraid for the terror by night nor yield to the crafts and asserts of the devil, our wicked Foe. Grant us peaceful rest in the protection of Your holy angels, that we may wake to glorify Your name and live in the hope of everlasting life; through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, our Savior and only Refuge. Amen."

Grant us eyes of faith that we may recognize Your presence, as You are revealed when the Holy Scriptures are opened and in the mystical union of the breaking of the bread. Be Thou our Solace, Strength, and Stay, that we may be preserved in body and in soul. Hear us for Thy name's sake, O Lord, our Savior. Amem."
