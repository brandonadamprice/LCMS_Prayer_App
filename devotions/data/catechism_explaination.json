      "title": "The First Commandment",
      "commandment": "The First Commandment: Thou shalt have no other gods.",
      "explanation": "This commandment is defined in the Large Catechism as the **chief source and fountainhead** from which all others flow. To have a god is essentially to have something from which the heart expects all good and to which it takes refuge in all distress. It is the **confidence and faith of the heart** alone that make both God and an idol. Martin Luther identifies Mammon, or money and property, as the most common idol in the world, asserting that whatever the heart clings to is truly that person's god. This commandment requires us to **fear, love, and trust in God above all things**, serving as the basis for all human accountability.",

      "explanation": "This commandment forbids using God's name to lie, deceive, curse, or practice magic. Positively, it mandates that Christians **call upon God's name in every trouble** and use it for prayer, praise, and thanksgiving. Luther emphasizes that **prayer is a strict duty and obligation** commanded by God, carrying the same weight as the prohibition against murder. The name of God is considered profaned when those who claim to be His children live evil lives or teach false doctrines that misrepresent His Word.",

      "explanation": "In Lutheran theology, the literal requirement to rest on the seventh day was given specifically to the Jewish nation and is not legally binding on Christians. However, the moral substance remains: we are to **honor and gladly hear the preaching of God's Word**. The Sabbath is not made holy by the act of resting itself, but by **God's Word**, which Luther calls the 'treasure that sanctifies everything.' Whenever the Word is preached, heard, or pondered, both the person and the day are made holy. Neglecting the public administration of the Word and Sacraments is a violation of this command.",

      "explanation": "God places parenthood in a position of honor second only to Himself. All earthly authority is viewed as **flowing and being propagated from the authority of parents**. This includes 'fathers in blood' (biological parents), 'fathers in office' (civil government), and 'spiritual fathers' (pastors). Parents are charged with bringing up their children in the **fear and knowledge of God** and providing for their education so they can serve society.

Positively, Luther emphasizes that we should **assist and serve our neighbor in every bodily danger or need**.

Luther understands marriage as a divine order and mystery that reflects the relationship between Christ and the Church. It forbids not only physical adultery but also **impure thoughts and the destruction of marriage's purpose** through lust. Marriage is held in high esteem because God sanctioned and guarded it as the highest estate for the procreation of children and the stability of society.",

Luther applies this to **economic ethics**, condemning usury, greed, and 'legal' tricks used to obtain property.

Christians are commanded to defend their neighbor, speak well of them, and **put the best construction on everything they do**. Luther emphasizes the 'order of the Gospel' from Matthew 18, which instructs that a brother's fault should be addressed privately before being made public, using the tongue to cover infirmities rather than expose them.",

It specifically addresses seeking to obtain a neighbor's **inheritance or home** through 'wicked cunning' or a 'show of right.' Luther notes that this commandment is addressed especially to the **most pious**, who may not break external laws but still harbor envy or avarice in the heart.
