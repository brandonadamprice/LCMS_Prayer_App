    {
      "title": "The First Commandment",
      "commandment": "The First Commandment: Thou shalt have no other gods.",
      "explanation": "This commandment is defined in the Large Catechism as the **chief source and fountainhead** from which all others flow. To have a god is essentially to have something from which the heart expects all good and to which it takes refuge in all distress. It is the **confidence and faith of the heart** alone that make both God and an idol. Martin Luther identifies Mammon, or money and property, as the most common idol in the world, asserting that whatever the heart clings to is truly that person's god. This commandment requires us to **fear, love, and trust in God above all things**, serving as the basis for all human accountability.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "According to the Large Catechism, what is the 'maker' of a god?",

            "A person's good works and rituals",
            "The confidence and faith of the heart",

            "The specific name used in prayer"

    {
      "title": "The Second Commandment",
      "commandment": "The Second Commandment: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain.",
      "explanation": "This commandment forbids using God's name to lie, deceive, curse, or practice magic. Positively, it mandates that Christians **call upon God's name in every trouble** and use it for prayer, praise, and thanksgiving. Luther emphasizes that **prayer is a strict duty and obligation** commanded by God, carrying the same weight as the prohibition against murder. The name of God is considered profaned when those who claim to be His children live evil lives or teach false doctrines that misrepresent His Word.",

    {
      "title": "The Third Commandment",
      "commandment": "The Third Commandment: Thou shalt sanctify the holy-day.",
      "explanation": "In Lutheran theology, the literal requirement to rest on the seventh day was given specifically to the Jewish nation and is not legally binding on Christians. However, the moral substance remains: we are to **honor and gladly hear the preaching of God's Word**. The Sabbath is not made holy by the act of resting itself, but by **God's Word**, which Luther calls the 'treasure that sanctifies everything.' Whenever the Word is preached, heard, or pondered, both the person and the day are made holy. Neglecting the public administration of the Word and Sacraments is a violation of this command.",

    {
      "title": "The Fourth Commandment",
      "commandment": "The Fourth Commandment: Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother.",
      "explanation": "God places parenthood in a position of honor second only to Himself. All earthly authority is viewed as **flowing and being propagated from the authority of parents**. This includes 'fathers in blood' (biological parents), 'fathers in office' (civil government), and 'spiritual fathers' (pastors). Parents are charged with bringing up their children in the **fear and knowledge of God** and providing for their education so they can serve society. Honoring parents involves serving and obeying them for God's sake, recognizing them as His representatives.",

      "title": "The Fifth Commandment",
      "commandment": "The Fifth Commandment: Thou shalt not kill.",
      "explanation": "This commandment prohibits murder and physical harm, but also targets the roots of violence: **anger, hatred, and bitterness**. Positively, Luther emphasizes that we should **assist and serve our neighbor in every bodily danger or need**. A Christian is called to have a patient and gentle heart, doing good even to those who are enemies. Any harm done to a neighbor, including through the manipulation of laws to damage their well-being, stands condemned under this heading.",

      "commandment": "The Sixth Commandment: Thou shalt not commit adultery.",
      "explanation": "This commandment mandates a **chaste and decent life in words and deeds** and requires that husbands and wives **love and honor each other**. Luther understands marriage as a divine order and mystery that reflects the relationship between Christ and the Church. It forbids not only physical adultery but also **impure thoughts and the destruction of marriage's purpose** through lust. Marriage is held in high esteem because God sanctioned and guarded it as the highest estate for the procreation of children and the stability of society.",

      "commandment": "The Seventh Commandment: Thou shalt not steal.",
      "explanation": "This commandment protects the rights of ownership and forbids the right acquisition of goods through fraud or dishonest business practices. Luther applies this to **economic ethics**, condemning usury, greed, and 'legal' tricks used to obtain property. He labels those who exploit others under the pretext of right as **'swivel-chair robbers.'** The positive requirement is to **help the neighbor improve and protect his possessions and income**, recognizing private ownership as divinely ordained.",

      "commandment": "The Eighth Commandment: Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.",
      "explanation": "The focus here is on **governing the tongue** and protecting the neighbor's reputation. It forbids lying about, slandering, or betraying others. Christians are commanded to defend their neighbor, speak well of them, and **put the best construction on everything they do**. Luther emphasizes the 'order of the Gospel' from Matthew 18, which instructs that a brother's fault should be addressed privately before being made public, using the tongue to cover infirmities rather than expose them.",

      "commandment": "The Ninth Commandment: Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.",
      "explanation": "This commandment targets **internal desires and 'impure thoughts'** that lead a person to seek what belongs to their neighbor. It specifically addresses seeking to obtain a neighbor's **inheritance or home** through 'wicked cunning' or a 'show of right.' Luther notes that this commandment is addressed especially to the **most pious**, who may not break external laws but still harbor envy or avarice in the heart. It reveals the deep-seated 'evil infection' of human nature that persists even when outward works appear good.",

      "explanation": "The Tenth Commandment focuses on the **alienation or enticement** of the people and creatures that serve the neighbor. It forbids driving away or forcing a neighbor’s spouse or workers to leave. Luther emphasizes that we should instead **urge them to stay and do their duty** in the places where God has put them. These final commandments serve as a mirror to show that no one is fully pure in heart, pointing the believer to the need for the forgiveness found in the Gospel.",

  "conclusion": "The Ten Commandments are considered the only part of the Law of Moses that is eternal, inscribed on the hearts of all men as natural law. Outside of these commandments, **no work can be good or pleasing to God**, no matter how great it appears to the world. Their primary purpose is to reveal God's wrath against sin, acting as a mirror to show our inability to save ourselves and guiding the 'new man' on the path of good works that are pleasing to God."
