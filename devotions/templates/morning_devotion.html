          I thank You, my heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Your dear Son, that You have kept
          me this night from all harm and danger; and I pray that You would keep me this day also
          from sin and every evil, that all my doings and life may please You. For into Your hands I
          commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Your holy angel be with me, that the
          evil foe may have no power over me. Amen.
