          Almighty God, merciful Father, who created and completed all things, on this day when the
          work of our calling begins anew, we implore You to create its beginning, direct its
          continuance, and bless its end, that our doings may be preserved from sin, our life
          sanctified, and our work this day be well pleasing to You; through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
          Amen.

          I thank You, my heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Your dear Son, that You have kept
          me this night from all harm and danger; and I pray that You would keep me this day also
          from sin and every evil, that all my doings and life may please You. For into Your hands I
          commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Your holy angel be with me, that the
          evil foe may have no power over me. Amen.
