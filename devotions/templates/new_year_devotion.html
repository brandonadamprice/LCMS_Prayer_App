        <p>O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth: who has set Your glory above the heavens. What is man that You are mindful of him: and the Son of Man that You visit Him?</p>
        <p>You, O Lord, are our Father and our Redeemer: Your name is from everlasting.</p>
        <p><strong>Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit; as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. </strong></p>
        <p>O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth: who has set Your glory above the heavens.</p>

        <p>O Lord God, who for our sakes made Your blessed Son, our Savior, subject to the Law and caused Him to endure the circumcision of the flesh, grant us the true circumcision of the Spirit that our hearts may be pure from all sinful desires and lusts; through the same Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, ever one God, world without end. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>

        <p>As we stand at the threshold of a new year, the world looks inward, making resolutions based on human strength to improve the self. The Church, however, looks to Christ. Historically, the church celebrates January 1st not merely as the start of a calendar year, but as the Festival of the Circumcision and the Name of Jesus.</p>
        <p>On the eighth day of his life, our Lord first shed his blood for us. He placed himself under the Law to redeem those who were under the Law. He received the name Jesus, which means "The Lord Saves." As we face an unknown year, we do not know what joys or sorrows await us. But we do know that we enter this year bearing the name of Him who is "from everlasting".</p>
        <p>As you number your days, do not place your confidence in the changing times or your own resolve, but in the name of Jesus. As the Introit for this day proclaims: "O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth: who hast set Thy glory above the heavens".</p>

            Help us, O Lord! Behold, we enter<br>
            Upon another year today;<br>
            In Thee our hopes and thoughts now center,<br>
            Renew our courage for the way.<br>
            New life, new strength, new happiness,<br>
            We ask of Thee, — oh, hear and bless!

        <p>Almighty and everlasting God, from whom comes down every good and perfect gift, we give You thanks for all Your benefits, temporal and spiritual, bestowed upon us in the year past. We implore You of Your goodness, grant us a favorable and joyful year, defend us from all dangers and adversities, and send upon us the fullness of Your blessing; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, ever one God, world without end. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
