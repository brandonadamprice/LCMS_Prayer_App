      This website was created by Brandon Price, a layman in The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod. 
      Brandon currently serves as an Elder at First Trinity Evangelical Lutheran
      Church in Pittsburgh, PA. He has formerly served as the Financial Secretary, President, and
      a member of the Endowment Fund Committee at First Trinity.
      He is also on the board of Pittsburgh Area Lutheran Ministries serving as their treasurer.

    <p>
      This website started off as a way for Brandon to have easy access to his personal evening
      devotion (currently the Extended Evening Devotion on this website), without having to flip
      through multiple documents. He then expanded the scope of the website to include other
      devotions, such as daily prayers and readings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this project is to provide a simple, convenient way for
      individuals and families to engage in daily prayer, Scripture reading, and
      reflection on the Catechism, according to the traditions and rhythms of
      the church year as observed in the LCMS. The prayers, readings, and
      liturgical elements are drawn from publicly available LCMS resources and
      historic Lutheran practices to encourage a life centered in God's Word
      and prayer.
